##Usage

###Install
We strongly encourage you to use CocoaPods. It's simple, just add the dependency to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '7.0'

pod 'CADVoteCountView'
```

And then running `pod install` will install the dependencies.

Finally, import the header file wherever you want to use it:

```objc
#import "CADVoteCountView.h"
```

And you are done!

### Demo

To check the demo, first install the dependencies with CocoaPods. After that, build and run the `Example` project in Xcode.


### Initialization
You should always instantiate the view programmatically (loading from nib not supported yet). In order to do so, usage of voteCountViewWithType: creation method is mandatory.

Refer to the header file [`CADVoteCountView.h`](Source/CADVoteCountView.h) for more documentation.
